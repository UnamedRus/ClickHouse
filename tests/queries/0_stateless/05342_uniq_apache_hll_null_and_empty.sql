-- ^ DataSketches is not built in fast-test builds.

-- `NULL` values and empty strings are ignored by the Apache DataSketches implementations in Java, Python
-- and C++, and by Spark's `hll_sketch_agg`, so a sketch built here must ignore them too.
-- Unlike `uniq`, an empty string is therefore not counted as a value.
