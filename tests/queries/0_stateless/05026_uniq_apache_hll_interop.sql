-- The state of `uniqApacheHLL` carries an Apache DataSketches HLL sketch in its native serialized
-- form, framed with the varint length prefix that `writeVectorBinary` adds. Every blob below was
-- produced by the Apache DataSketches C++ library directly rather than by ClickHouse, so these
-- queries pin the wire contract with external producers in both directions. A change that breaks
-- interoperability has to change one of these literals.
