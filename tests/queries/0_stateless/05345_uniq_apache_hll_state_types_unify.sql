-- The parameters of `uniqApacheHLL` (`lg_k` and the storage type) do not change what a state means: every sketch carries
-- its own configuration, so states of any parameters can be merged. The types of such states are therefore the same type
-- for the places that need a common type, and not only convertible with `CAST`.
